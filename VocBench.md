# Introduction #

VocBench is a web-based, multilingual, vocabulary editing and workflow tool.


# Details #

It transforms thesauri, authority lists and glossaries into SKOS/RDF concept schemes for use in a linked data environment. It supports a growing set of user communities, including the global, distributed group of terminologists who manage AGROVOC, a multi-lingual agricultural thesaurus of 32,000 terms in over 22 languages. VocBench also manages the workflow and editorial processes implied by vocabulary evolution such as user rights/roles, validation and versioning. In addition VocBench features a flexible set of auxiliary web services that permit other applications to interact with VocBench vocabularies using REST queries. Developed in Java, it leverages the Google Web Toolkit to support a rich-client interface and is released under a GPL license.
