# Working with the issue tracker #

The owner is the reporter of the issue (this doesn't change).
Once, somebody picks up the issue to work on it, you change the status to "started" and put your name in the cc field (you can do this).
Once you fixed the issue, you change the status to "Fixed".
Then FAO will check on the online version, and if we are ok with it, we change the status to "Verified" and the issue is closed.

# Reporting #

Every two weeks (latest!), Ton and Sachit send a little summary report (via email to Margherita) of what has been achieved within the last 2 weeks and what issues need to be resolved next. Any problems to solve shall also be reported here.

# Updates of the system #

The development team at Kasetsart shall at least every two weeks or when modifications are stable update the online system at the stable web site http://naist.cpe.ku.ac.th/agrovoc/ so that testing users can see changes.
Minor updates on the development links should be sent as they are done via email to Margherita in the meantime.
