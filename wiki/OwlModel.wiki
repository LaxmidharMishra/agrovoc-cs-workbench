#summary OWL Model and URI discussion

Back to the [Main] 

= Introduction =

This page is to discuss latest changes in the OWL model and about the URIs


= OWL Model changes =

We have added a new relationship
  * hasStemmedForm: subrelationship of datatype relationship hasTermVariant


= URIs =

The final base URI of the ontology is:

http://www.fao.org/aims/aos/agrovoc

all *concepts* will have the following form:

http://www.fao.org/aims/aos/agrovoc/c_1234
with the 'fake' instance:
http://www.fao.org/aims/aos/agrovoc/i_1234 (used for the relationships and lexicalizations)

Lexicalizations (terms) will then have the follwing URIs:
http://www.fao.org/aims/aos/agrovoc/i_en_1234
http://www.fao.org/aims/aos/agrovoc/i_fr_1234
http://www.fao.org/aims/aos/agrovoc/i_th_1234
......

If there are more terms in one language, the URIs of each subsequent term will be as follows:
http://www.fao.org/aims/aos/agrovoc/i_en_1234_1 (synonym)
http://www.fao.org/aims/aos/agrovoc/i_en_1234_2 (synonym)
...

All *relationships* will use the English term as a basis for the relationship, and the URI will be of the form 
http://www.fao.org/aims/aos/agrovoc/hasPest
http://www.fao.org/aims/aos/agrovoc/means
http://www.fao.org/aims/aos/agrovoc/hasLexicalization
...

so it uses the Camel Case of the English term (small letters, beginning of each word capitalized, words attached)
