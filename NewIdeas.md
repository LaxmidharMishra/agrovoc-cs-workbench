# Introduction #

This page shall summarize ideas for improvement or enhancement of the current system.


# 1. Keep track of rejections #

Lori Finch from NAL mentioned that in her system they keep track of previously rejected proposals. This could acutally be useful for our system as well.
We could actually keep rejected items (concepts, terms) in a database together with the reason for rejection. Each new proposal will then first be checked against this database. If there is a match, the user will be presented with a warning, that this term has previously been rejected for this following reason and then asked, if he wants to propose this anyways, but also asked to enter a reason for the repeated proposal.

# 2. Hidden terms #

The other idea from NAL is to feed the system with 'hidden terms' (skos:hiddenTerm). These can be saved automatically from user queries, like a user types in with spelling mistakes etc. such terms can then be used in automatic indexing, searching etc.

# 3. Make it like a game #

In order to motivate people to use the system and keep them active, we should incorporate game like features. Like 'the user with the most edits / week or month' ...
