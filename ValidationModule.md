  * If I create a new concept as 'same level' concept, the concept that has been marked when creating the new concept should NOT be taken as concept for the validation module. it's misleading. It should always be the parent concept, or if there is no parent concept, then the plain text "Top Level Concept" should be displayed without hyperlink in the concept column of the validation table.
  * Validation needs to be implemented also for the classification schemes
