CONCEPTS:

- still to be removed: C_ENTITY_ANNOTATION
- also, find a better replacement for the two subclasses of C_ENTITY_ANNOTATION

OBJECT PROPERTIES:

- everything as foreseen, nothing still to be done

DATATYPE PROPERTIES:

- following properties:
		conceptEditorialDatatypeProperty 
		conceptDomainDatatypeProperty    
		termDomainDatatypeProperty       
		termEditorialDatatypeProperty    
	need to be removed and domain/ranges need to be set explicitly (currently they act as abstract properties for letting other props inherit domain/range)
	
- The following properties:
		hasPlural          
		hasSingular        
		hasSpellingVariant 
		hasStemmedForm     
		hasTermVariant     
	have got their range corrected from xsd:string to plain literal, as they are actually used in the workbench.
	However, on a second stage, they should be changed to use more appropriate properties from skos.
